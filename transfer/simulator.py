'''
Simulate an entire game between two teams, each representing an NFL team in a
single season. So, teams from two different seasons can play each other. This
simulation is meant to demonstrate what would happen if each team were to call
the best play possible in each scenario, not just choose the play they
would have most likely run themselves. We seek to know who would win if each
team had the best play-calling possible, not the play calling they actually had.

The simulated plays are determined by finding the best play type (pass deep left,
run middle, etc.) based on how often the team ran the play (if they ran it more
often it is better) and how good the outcomes were (measured by the increase in
the points the team was expected to score after the play). From there, we call the
play and randomly choose an outcome from when the offense ran that play or the
defense defended against that play in the past. We then update the situation
and continue simulating until the end of the game.
